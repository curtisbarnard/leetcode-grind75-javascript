## Data Structures
In order to practice with similar data structures I'll be placing each problem in the categories below, along with some similar problems nested below to help practice with those data structures.

### Array
1. [Two Sum](https://github.com/curtisbarnard/leetcode-grind75-javascript/blob/main/easy/twosum-1.md)

### Hash Table
1. [Two Sum](https://github.com/curtisbarnard/leetcode-grind75-javascript/blob/main/easy/twosum-1.md)

## Algorithm Patterns
Within the problems above there are several patterns that often occur. I plan to categorize each problem such that if you are having problem with a particular pattern you can look for other similar problems that use the same pattern.

### Sliding Window

### Two Pointers

### Fast & Slow Pointers

### Merge Intervals

### Cyclic Sort

### In-place Reversal of Linked List

### Tree Breadth First Search

### Tree Depth First Search

### Two Heaps

### Subsets

### Modified Binary Search

### Top K Elements

### K-Way Merge

### Topological Sort
