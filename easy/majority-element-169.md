Page on leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

## Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

### Constraints

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### Example

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
